--dry-run should not change mtime of letsencrypt directory
Contributor's comment:
"This is probably because lock configuration directory (by creating and
removing a file) when Certbot is run."
"Unfortunately, Certbot doesn't exactly follow the Linux FHS. While I
don't think there is a single directory that is standard for lockfiles
across all UNIX systems (see FreeBSD for instance), you could argue
that putting the lockfile somewhere in /var is standard. We had
problems with this which are explained at the bottom of #4449
(comment).
While I'm sorry for the trouble and would be open to changing this in
the future, I don't think we want to break backwards compatibility by
moving the lockfile to another location right now."
