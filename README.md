Notes
-----

1) certbot certonly vs. renew
* *certbot certonly* can "Obtain or renew a certificate, but do not install it"
* *certbot renew* can "Renew all previously obtained certificates that are near expiry"

2) Rate Limits for Letâ€™s Encrypt                              
https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/
* 20 certificates per domain per week
* 5 certificates per FQDN set per week
* 100 names per certificate. A certificate with multiple names is often called a SAN certificate, or sometimes a UCC certificate.
* The number of registrations you can make in a given time period; currently 500 per 3 hours                                                                                                   
  
3) Lifetime of the certificate (Pros and cons of 90-day certificate lifetimes)                                           
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/pros-and-cons-of-90-day-certificate-lifetimes                                             The Technical Advisory Board chose                                                                                           * 90-day certificate lifetime to start with                                                                                   * with an expectation that people will want to auto-renew at the 60-day mark.                                                  
4) Certbot will not renew a certificate more then 30 days before expiration. Message: Cert not yet due for renewal.

5) Daily dry-run renewal is recommended. "This verifies whether you're apparently able to get a certificate, in your current configuration ... You can use this to simulate what would apparently happen if you ran the command without --dry-run." [Q. What's the new --dry-run flag?] (https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/help-us-test-renewal-with-letsencrypt-renew/10562)
